> This app comes with the following user roles: admins, teachers, and students

- **Admins** can reset passwords of students and teachers
- **Teachers** can add and remove documents
- **Teachers** can build and remove knowledge base (VectorStores)
- **Admins** can edit knowledge base and documents
- **Admins** share documents among the 5 teachers
- **Students** can load their own knowledge base for their own chatbot
